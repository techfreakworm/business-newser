The economic impacts are still unclear. If that\\'s the case, we\\'ll continue seeing reasonable support for gold,\" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.\\nCOVID-19 Vaccine\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\nA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.\\nThere are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.\\nVaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.\\nHowever, he said that a rise in China\\'s January producer and consumer prices \"minutely hurt\" gold.\\nAlso capping gold\\'s gains, the dollar touched a four-month peak earlier in the session against a basket of rival currencies after robust U.S non-farm payrolls data on Friday.\\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve said the U.S. economy slowed last year on weak global growth, but the likelihood of recession has declined.\\nThe central bank flagged as risks the fallout from the coronavirus, \"elevated\" asset values and near-record levels of low-grade corporate debt.\\n\"Investors should continue to favour more defensive fixed income and, therefore, long gold positions until the impact of nCoV on growth becomes apparent,\" Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp, said in a note.\\nHoldings of the world\\'s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund SPDR Gold Trust rose 0.13% to 916.08 tonnes on Friday, its highest since Oct. 29.\\nDownload your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes \\n \\n'},\n",

In two separate circulars, the regulator specified the manner of issuance of units under the rights issue by listed real estate investment trusts (REITs) and infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs).\\nSEBI said the issuer will have to disclose objects of the issue, related-party transactions, valuation, financial details, review of credit rating and grievance redressal mechanism in the placement document.\\nThe regulator had first notified REIT and InvIT Regulations in 2014, allowing setting up and listing of such trusts which are popular in some advanced markets.\\nEver since SEBI introduced InvITs, the market witnessed listing of two public InvITs — IRB InvIT Fund and India Grid Trust, while three InvITs — IndInfravit Trust, India Infrastructure Trust and Oriental InfraTrust — were privately placed. On the other hand, Embassy Office Parks REIT is the only listed real estate investment trust.\\nSEBI has allowed listed REITs and InvITs to make a rights issue of units.\\nThis is subject to several conditions including these investment vehicles obtaining in-principle approval of the stock exchanges for listing of units proposed to be issued, besides none of the respective promoters or partners or directors of the sponsor or manager or trustee of the REIT and InvIT is a fugitive economic offender and should not be barred from the securities market.\\nWith regard to pricing, SEBI said that the investment manager on behalf of the REIT and InvIT, in consultation with the lead merchant banker(s), will decide the issue price before determining the record date.\\nThe investment manager, on behalf of InvIT and REIT need to announce the record date to stock exchange at least three working days (excluding the date of intimation and the record date) prior to the record date. InvIT and REIT will not withdraw its rights issue after announcement of the record date.\\nWith regard to manner of issuance of unit, SEBI said that units shall be allotted in the dematerialised form only and shall be listed on the stock exchange where the units of the REIT and InvIT are listed.\\n\"The minimum subscription to be received in the rights issue shall be 90 per cent of the issue size through the letter of offer, \" Sebi noted.\\nThe InvIT and REIT \"shall not make any further issue of units in any manner whether by way of public issue, rights issue, preferential issue, qualified institutions placement, institutional placement, issue of bonus shares or otherwise during the period between the date of filing the draft letter of offer with the board and the listing of the units offered through the letter of offer or refund of application monies.\"\\nDownload your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes \\n \\n'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Indian shares fell around 3 percent, mirroring global counterparts, as fears of the coronavirus outbreak turning into a pandemic and hitting growth made the markets jittery across the world.\\nChina, where the virus originated, has seen a decline in infections and deaths but the virus that causes the flu-like disease called COVID-19 has spread to other parts of the world, including South Korea, Nigeria, Iran, New Zealand, Italy, France and the US.\\nInfected cases worldwide increased to 83,342, with death toll at 2,858, which China accounting for most of the deaths and infections.\\nChina has now been battling the novel coronavirus for almost two months.\\nWorried investors and analysts have started cutting economic growth projections for the Asian giant and raised red flag for global growth also, as China is the second-largest economy in the world, say experts.\\n\"As the coronavirus is spreading across the countries, the fear factor in markets is going up. Till the time the coronavirus was contained in Mainland China there was compliancy in global equity markets but now as more cases are getting reported in various countries the impact is sharper,\" said Rusmik Oza, Senior VP (Head of Fundamental Research-PCG), Kotak Securities.\\nUmesh Mehta, Head of Research at Samco Securities, also said from extreme calmness to extreme pessimism, D-Street was also a victim of the virus outbreak in other countries. \"This pandemic led to indices across the globe to witness a sharp fall this week,\" he said.\\nThe BSE Sensex plunged 1,215.14 points or 3.06 percent to 38,530.52 and the Nifty50 fell 362.50 points or 3.12 percent to 11,270.80, taking the total weekly loss to 6.4 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively.\\nThe Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices also fell in line with benchmarks, falling more than 7 percent on weekly basis.\\nGlobal rating agency Moody\\'s expects a recession-kind of a situation if the virus stays for a longer period.\\n\"There is a 40 percent chance that the coronavirus outbreak turns into a pandemic—when an epidemic spreads globally and affects a large number of people worldwide — and that if such a situation arises, then it would \\'result in global and US recessions during the first half of this year,\" CNBC-TV18 quoted Moody’s Analytics as saying.\\nThe fall in six consecutive sessions suggested that the market seem to have started pricing in the likely impact of the virus on earnings and economy.\\nThe first quarter of CY20 is expected to be weak but the second quarter, too, may see some weakness if the virus persists.\\n\"There is no reason India is any less immune to coronavirus than anywhere else. At least, the first quarter (Q1CY20) is a wipe-out and that, I think, was largely expected anyway and is now imbued in prices,\" Mark Matthews of Julius Baer & Co told CNBC-TV18.\\nGautam Chhaochharia of UBS Securities said, \"Base case for the markets till now globally and in India has been that it\\'s a short-term one-off and the markets and economy will rebound fairly quickly but now it\\'s getting prolonged and that\\'s what is causing nervousness that prolonged impact of this could have far bigger impact in terms of economic activity globally.\"\\nThe market is expected to see some lingering effect of virus, but the market had started looking oversold and throwing a lot of opportunities to accumulate, experts say.\\n\"During past instances like coronavirus, markets fell gradually and recovered gradually. This time the fall has been vertical and that too in a matter of few days. Going by past precedence, the recovery in markets (post containment of such epidemics) is equal or higher than the fall. As the fall has been too-fast-too-soon, markets have gone into oversold zone (ie RSI of Nifty-50 has gone to 25 level),\" Oza said.\\nSince the risk-reward ratio had turned favourable for the market, it was ideal to accumulate stocks keeping in mind the downside of 11,000 for the Nifty, he said.\\n\"Indian bourses have been trading around higher valuations and hence a correction was needed to align the markets as per the mean reversion theory. Hence, this week’s fall is a valuation play with coronavirus as the scapegoat,” Mehta of Samco Securities said.\\n\"Investors should not burn their hands by selling in this fall. They should slowly and steadily pick reasonably valued quality stocks in a SIP format as every dip becomes a good buying opportunity.\"\\nDownload your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes \\n \\n'}}"
